Privacy-first social platform. No ads, no algorithms, no surveillance. Private groups, encrypted messaging, live streaming, and cultural tools — all in one app.

## Description
0G is the privacy-first community platform built for people who are tired of being tracked, targeted, and surveilled by social media.

**Your privacy is not for sale.**
Unlike other platforms, 0G never sells your data, never shows you ads, and never uses algorithms to manipulate your feed. Your conversations are yours — private and never monetized.

**Your circle, your rules.**
Stay in your family group and never be seen by anyone else. Or join the larger community when you're ready. You control who sees you, who can message you, and what you see.

**Everything you need in one place.**
- Private groups and communities
- Direct messaging
- Photo and video sharing
- Live streaming
- Community boards and events
- Cultural tools (prayer times, Qibla compass, Quran reader, and more)

**Built for people, not profits.**
0G was built by people who know what it's like to be surveilled, silenced, and sold out. This is the platform we needed. Now it's yours.

No ads. No algorithms. No surveillance. Just you and your people.
