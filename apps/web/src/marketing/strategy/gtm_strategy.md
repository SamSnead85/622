# 0G (Zero Gravity) Go-To-Market Strategy: "The Great Migration"

## core_philosophy
**"Don't just build an audience. Migrate your Tribe."**

The era of "building a following" on algorithmic platforms is ending. Creators and users are tired of renting their audience from billionaires. Only 0G offers **Sovereign Reach**—direct access to 100% of your community, 100% of the time.

## 1. The "Anti-Algorithm" Narrative (Viral Hook)
**The Problem**: "Why do I only see 10% of the people I follow?"
**The 0G Solution**: **The Compass (Zen Mode)**.
*   **Marketing Angle**: "Escape the Doom Scroll." Market 0G not as "another social app", but as a "Social Sanctuary".
*   **Campaign**: #RetakeYourMind. Share side-by-side comparisons of a "Chaos Feed" (Competitor) vs a "Zen Feed" (0G).

## 2. The "Tribe Migration" Strategy (User Acquisition)
Instead of acquiring users one-by-one, acquire them **group-by-group**.
*   **Target**: WhatsApp Groups, Discord Servers, Telegram Channels.
*   **The Pitch**: "Move your group chat to 0G. Keep the privacy, but gain a customized 'Tribe Feed' where you can share photos/videos in high fidelity without them getting lost in a chat log."
*   **Feature leverage**: The `ScopeMode` (Tribe vs Orbit) I implemented allows users to toggle between "Group Chat Mode" (Tribe) and "Public Feed Mode" (Orbit).

## 3. "Founding Member" Scarcity (Growth Hack)
Leverage the "New Members Banner" and "Invite Codes".
*   **Mechanism**: Issue "Golden Tickets". Each user gets only 5 invites.
*   **Status**: Profile badges for "First 1000", "First 10,000".
*   **Action**: We can update the `Profile` component to display a "Founding Member" badge for early adopters.

## 4. "Sovereign Reach" for Creators (Influencer Strategy)
Target mid-tier creators (10k-50k followers) who are frustrated with Instagram's algorithm changes.
*   **Proposition**: "On Instagram, 5% see your post. On 0G, 100% of your Tribe sees it."
*   **Tool**: The "Direct Support" dashboard we built. Show them the "0% Platform Fee" metric.

## 5. Technical Implementation Roadmap
1.  **Golden Ticket visual**: Update the Invite page to look like a premium "Ticket" rather than just a link.
2.  **Tribe Onboarding**: Create a specific flow for "Create a Tribe" that invites members immediately.
3.  **Cross-Platform Story Sharing**: Easy "Share to Instagram Story" button that generates a visually stunning image of their 0G profile/post.

**Next Immediate Step**: Refine the `InvitePage` to look more exclusive (Golden Ticket aesthetic) to drive FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out).
